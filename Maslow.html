        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <ol class="num-list">
          <li>1. Users are required to go to each social media account to post.</li>
          <li>2. It may be tough to pull the analytics from each account making it hard to track/monitor post success and retweets.</li>
          <li>3. it can be difficult to schedule posts and then edit them for each network.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p class="num-list par-space">People want to know who is looking at their posts and who is clicking on their links. They wish to curate posts that better engage with their followers.</p>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <ol class="num-list">
          <li>1. Introduce a clean feeds screen.</li>
          <li>2. create simple flow for posting to multiple social media sites and edit each.</li>
          <li>3. make tags easier to utilize. </li>
          <li>4. create a clean scheduler.</li>

              <li>3. The people who want to customize posts for each network while making sure they have an increase in followers and likes;</li>
              <li>4. The people are curious about who sees their posts but really doesn’t care who follows them or likes their content; and</li>
              <li>5. The business who want to track link clicks, user and do all of the above.</li>

          </div><!-- for vertical line  -->
          <p class="caseStudy-text padding-top">I happen to be the fourth type of person. Over the years, I have used any social media networks; some stayed around while others fizzled. When idea arose to create a site that could make using all social media sites easier I jumped on board! I think everyone can agree that any process made simple is one they will use more.</p>

One of the most significant complications will be getting established, like Buffer; it can be hard to stand out in an industry with monsters like Sprout Social- that is a younger company that better at analytics than their older more trusted competitors- or HootSuite that is one of the oldest and most trusted SMM apps.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">People want to connect with as many people as they can. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">There are already some big companies in the social media management industry. Buffer does posting flawlessly, hoot-suite is a trusted industry giant and sprout social is any power users playground. But people want a good medium between all of these excellent options that aren’t expensive. Not to mention we all need to give our eyes a break so a dark theme would be welcomed by most. Maslow combines a super clean layout with all of the impressive features people like and want. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Maslow isn’t perfect. No app ever is though. In my last round of user testing, I found that the “Post” button was still a bit confusing and it was unclear if the drop-down menu should have a traditional arrow or be a timer/clock/calendar icon. Then some of the titles need to be reworked, and of course, I’d need to do some most testing to figure out which analytic data is most important to users and move those tiles around. You know all of the small details - but I plan on making these updates so Stay Tuned. </p>
          <p class=" caseStudy-text subhead">LESSON Learned</p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">With this project there were many ups and downs - Like I can’t express how many graphs I had to look at and research to figure out the best way to show data. It was so much fun - sometimes overwhelming too. I can’t tell you what all of the graphs are called, but I can say data is so complicated and I have so much respect for designers that work with more complex data [ or any data visualizations]. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Lastly, I learned that it is more important to have finished “good enough” project than an unfinished “perfect” project.</p>
