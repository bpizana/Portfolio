          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <ol class="num-list">
            <li>1. It takes a lot of time to search for free resources of quality.</li>
            <li>2. It's expensive to explore different career paths or interests.</li>
            <li>3. Knowing the quality of a videos contents can be difficult.</li>
            <li>4. Saving courses from multiple sites can be hard to keep track of.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p class="num-list par-space">Most of our users go to third party sources to find reviews on courses or content and they often spend 2-4 hours searching for decent material. Some people even said they spent more then a week looking for ‘okay’ resources - thats just way to much time - and most of them ended uopaying for courses.</p>
          <h3>Solutions</h3>
          <ol class="num-list">
            <li>1. Create a site that collects courses and tutorials from other sites.</li>
            <li>2. Let the users decide why they are wanting to learn material and then proved them with suggestions.</li>
            <li>3. Show reviews for instructors and courses.</li>

            <p class="caseStudy-text">I made some general assumptions about people and resouces online:</p>

              <ol class="quote">
                <li>1. People want to learn new skills;</li>
                <li>2. but they aren't always sure its the path they want to take;</li>
                <li>3. If they are Unsure if a career path they don't want to spend money because there is chance they end up not pursuing the path; and </li>
                <li>4. There are tons of free resources out there but its hard to tell which are good. </li>
              </ol>
            </div><!-- for vertical line  -->
            <p class="caseStudy-text padding-top">Now-a-days I feel like most people have taken a course of some sort online. Some people have even tried to figure out if they like a certain career path by taking courses online. But it can be wuite difficult to do so. I’ve tried. Finding resouces that give you a good taste of any job market can be impossible at the very least you can find okay resouces to see if you have minial interest. I know I wanted an easier, cheaper way to learn what career oath i was most interested in… College is just too expensive for expiramenting.</p>

Now have a basic structure and some hierarchy, after a couple of quick user tests with the wireframe prototype I found that the Initial signup process was too long. I was asking for information like location and bio, which was unnecessary. So I removed that screen, and instead of making people choose their interests and their goals during the onboarding process I split that into two different sections that they can decide to go through and then later add more information from their dashboard.</p>

Above is a video of one of the 6 remote user tests I conducted. Some of the biggest take ways from initial user tests were that the search bar wasn’t obvious, pricing on courses didn’t make sense, and not all of the clickable items seemed clickable.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="caseStudy-text">Where do I start? Education is a very complicated part of our lives we all learn in different ways, and there are an endless number sites and methods to learn anything you want. So education is a pretty serious topic, but serious isn't motivating. So charter set out to make this serious and stressful experience more fun and at the very least more straightforward.</p>
                <p class="caseStudy-text">Charter fits into the education market in a fresh new way. We aren't trying to push you into buying some course that you may find you're not interested in halfway through. Instead, we collect all of the free classes online and when you tell us what your goal is we create a path for you to do learn that thing. So you have no downside, and if you want to explore different career paths, you can do that without stress and then choose to pay for more in-depth classes later when you know you want to take that path in your life.</p>
                <p class=" caseStudy-text subhead">LESSON Learned</p>
                <p class="caseStudy-text">Throughout this process, I learned so much about people and what they expect from simple sites. For example, even after the site purpose was explained to a few users, they still wanted the website to do more, like take notes and be their calendar. So one big takeaway was that if there is an all-in-one solution people will take that over a perfect partial solution. Secondly, I learned that small word changes in a user test could have a considerable difference in what people do. For Example, I ran two A and B tests for testing the search function one with the prompt “How would you learn French on this site?” and one with the prompt “How would you find a French course on this site?”, The second one went better and received far fewer comments about the prompt and more about the site. Then, the need for people to be able to explore life paths more freely is highly sought after. So many people want to explore what its like to be different things without paying thousands of dollars or spending hundreds of hours to find out it's just not for them. Let's create more meaningful products that solve issues like this; we deserve it.
